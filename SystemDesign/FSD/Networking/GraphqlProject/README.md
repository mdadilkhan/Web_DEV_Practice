3. **Resolvers**

   * How resolvers work per field
   * Chaining and composition
4. **Queries vs Mutations**

   * Differences and use cases
5. **Nested Queries and Aliases**

## üîí **Security & Authorization**

1. **Field-level Authorization**

   * Custom middleware or directive-based access control
2. **Rate Limiting**

   * Prevent expensive nested queries
3. **Depth Limiting & Query Complexity Analysis**

   * Tools like `graphql-depth-limit` and `graphql-query-complexity`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Advanced GraphQL**

1. **Custom Scalars**

   * e.g., Date, Email, JSON
2. **Directives**

   * Built-in (`@include`, `@skip`) and custom directives
3. **Fragments**

   * Reusable parts of queries
4. **Interface & Union Types**

   * For polymorphic data (e.g., `SearchResult = User | Post`)

---

## üîÅ **Real-time with Subscriptions**

1. **WebSocket setup**

   * Use with Apollo Server or GraphQL Yoga
2. **Pub/Sub pattern**

   * Integration with Redis or in-memory pub/sub

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Tooling & Libraries**

1. **Apollo Server / Client**
2. **GraphQL Code Generator**
3. **GraphQL Playground / Altair**
4. **GraphQL Modules / Schema Stitching**

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Best Practices**

1. **Schema-First vs Code-First Development**
2. **Modular GraphQL Architecture**

   * Domain-driven design for schema
3. **Federation & Microservices**

   * Apollo Federation
   * GraphQL Gateway
4. **Batching & Caching**

   * `DataLoader` for N+1 problem
   * Query-level caching

---

## üîå **Integrations**

1. **GraphQL with MongoDB (or SQL)**

   * Using Mongoose or Prisma
2. **Authentication**

   * JWT in context
3. **GraphQL Upload**

   * File upload support via scalar and `graphql-upload`

---

## üì¶ **Testing & DevOps**

1. **Testing Resolvers**

   * Unit & integration testing
2. **Error Handling & Formatting**
3. **Logging & Monitoring**

   * Apollo metrics, custom logging
4. **Schema Versioning**

   * Breaking vs non-breaking changes
   * Deprecation strategies

---

## üíº Must-Know Questions in Interviews

* How do you handle N+1 problem in GraphQL?
* What happens when you request deeply nested fields?
* How do you secure a public GraphQL endpoint?
* How do you design a scalable schema for microservices?
* How do you handle backward compatibility in GraphQL?
